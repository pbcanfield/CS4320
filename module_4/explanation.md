The spreadsheet included in this folder contains a list of components of a 
socio-techincal system which breaches several catagories of ethical principles 
for software engineers. The theoretical ethical issue which is being addressed 
here is a retail system which sells personal information to a third party for 
profit. In this case I have included five components of the socio-technical 
system. There are the software developers which write the software which 
manages customer private data. Workers who are the users of such software
which are responsible for selling products to customers. The retail software
itself, which collects private customer information and facilitates the 
exchange of money for products. Finally, there are the higher-ups, which make
companywide decisions about how software should be used.

The chart is structured such that a check mark means that this component of 
the socio-technical system has not violated the software engineering ethical 
principles. For instance, there is a checkmark at the intersection of software 
developers and products because even though software developers have created a 
system which stores and sells customer private data, developers have not violated
this specific ethical quandry because the software in question may be developed
to a high standard and perform its intened function correctly. However, on the other 
hand cross marks are used to denote that this ethical principle has been broken.
For instance, there is a cross mark at the intersection of Software developers 
and profession because designing software which does not advance the integreity and
reputation of software developers is not consistant with this ethical principle.
